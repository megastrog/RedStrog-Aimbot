Linux Aimbot for Quake Champions just set Enemy Outline to "ON" and Enemy Outline Color to red.

Make sure anti-aliasing is OFF in VIDEO settings.

Set mouse sensitivity to 1 with 0 acceleration. Otherwise adjust `mousescale_small` and `mousescale_large` variables accordingly in the source code, `mousescale_small` is for the MOUSE4/3/LSHIFT function and `mousescale_large` is for the MOUSE1/Autoaim function.

To improve game performance on Linux run it in a window and set the **LAUNCH OPTIONS** for Quake Champions as `RADV_PERFTEST=gpl %command%`.
